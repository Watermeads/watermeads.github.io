How and when did Freemasonry start?<P><H6><FONT SIZE="4" ><P>
It is not exactly known. The earliest recorded 'making' of a Freemason in England is that of Elias Ashmole in 1646.<P> 
Prior to 1600 (approx.) Lodges met in public houses and coffee shops, and little or no records were kept, however they began to organise themselves and Two Grand Lodges were formed,<P> 
The Anceints  and The Moderns, who after a period of time,meetings and discussions, they came together in 1717, to form the United Grand Lodge of England <P>
Organised Freemasonry, as we know it today, began with the founding of the Grand Lodge of England on 24 June 1717, the first Grand Lodge in the world. Ireland followed in 1725 and Scotland in 1736.
All the regular Grand Lodges in the world trace themselves back to one or more of the Grand Lodges in the British Isles.<P>

There are two main theories of origin. According to one, the operative stonemasons who built the great cathedrals and castles had lodges in which they discussed trade affairs. 
They had simple initiation ceremonies and, as there were no City and Guilds certificates, dues cards or trade union membership cards, they adopted secret signs and words to 
demonstrate that they were trained masons when they moved from site to site. <P>
In the 1600s, these operative lodges began to accept non-operatives as "gentlemen masons". Gradually these non-operative took over the lodges and turned them from operative 
to 'free and accepted' or 'speculative' lodge.<P>
The other theory is that in the late 1500s and early 1600s, there was a group which was interested in the promotion of religious and political tolerance in an age of great
intolerance when differences of opinion on matters of religion and politics were to lead to bloody civil war. In forming Freemasonry, they were trying to make better men and 
build a better world. As the means of teaching in those days was by allegory and symbolism, they took the idea of building as the central allegory on which to form their system. 
The main source of allegory was the Bible, the contents of which were known to everyone even if they could not read, and the only building described in detail 
in the Bible was king Solomon's Temple, which became the basis of the ritual. The old trade guilds provided them with their basis administration of a Master, Wardens,
 Treasurer and Secretary, and the operative mason's tools provided them with a wealth of symbols with which to illustrate the moral teachings of Freemasonry.<P>
How many degrees are there in Freemasonry ?<P>
Basic Freemasonry consists of the three 'Craft' degrees (Entered Apprentice, Fellow Craft and Master Mason) complemented by the Royal Arch degree (Chapter).<P>
There are many other Masonic degrees and Orders which are called 'additional' because they add to the basis of the Craft and Royal Arch. They add to Freemasonry by further 
expounding and illustrating the principles stated in the Craft and Royal Arch. Some of these additional degrees are
numerically superior to the third degree but this does not affect the fact that they are additional to and not in anyway superior to or higher than the Craft.
The ranks that these additional degrees carry have no standing with the Craft or Royal Arch.
